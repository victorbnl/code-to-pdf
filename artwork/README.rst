Artwork samples
===============

Examples to be used in artwork.

The artwork project itself is not in this
repository, but `available on Figma`_. Here is the current workflow I use for
editing it:

#. Generate all documents with ``build.sh``
#. Convert them to images with GIMP (600px/in resolution)
#. Replace each image on Figma by selecting it and pasting the new one
